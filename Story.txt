12 Missions

Base Story:
- Journey of a hero who battles his own mind
- in general this is a circular story
- In the beginning, sets of for a good cause
- thats where the cycle begins
- dragged further into the task (whatever the task is), good behavior aggravates
- people, companions are met, who present the good
- in the beginning they die by mere accidents (or something that at first feels and seems inevitable)
- later those are actually killed by the own hand
- the journey is about a mind getting darker and darker
- where the darkness tries to become the dominant part
- yet the journey path leads to the beginning, the consciousness
- which then again is still stronger
- this means the initial waking up is actually the moment the mind actually drifts away into darkness
- this also means, that any mission is an abstraction on how far would you go for a certain goal
- on this way, there are certain "hidden" hints that can explain this

1 Dednim'Krad (x)
- actually means dark-minded
- starts on a ship (where this mind-journey begins)
- Hint: Captain actually greets with "Ah, you are asleep" instead of awake
- Task: investigate problems in Dednim'Krad
- when arriving, city is under attack
- defend city first
- find out who attacked (clear out bandit camps, build some economy)
- after camps have been cleared, need to search why/how 

2 Dark Path
- this is about walking through an bandit infested forest
- here at some point next to a house, one meets the first good mind
- Hint: Oh, it's you again, which tells, that this isn't the first time, but is ignored by the hero
- Task: follow marauding bandit troops
- find some units in the forest, where one needs to use some helpfull army to actually kite away another army
- this is more a tactical movement map
- whenever the player fails, the mission ends with "I should have thought of that!"

2 Dark Path


3 Feral Forest 
- there is a bandit base around
- Task: Destroy the bandit camp
- there is a friendly village to the left (own buildings)
- the new friend tells you about it
- Hint: When you say, you will help them, the friend answers "Sure, you never do"
- since the way goes left and right (left village, right bandit camp) it doesn't matter which path you take
- as soon as you create an army and start roaming forth, you trigger a hostile army spawn who will destroy the village
- at this point the hero still says/thinks he could have saved them
- Hint: Friend tells, That sometimes you need to focus and can't change something, as hard as you think about it
- rebuild village for resources (as soon as x mines have been built, bandits will also start attacking, before that armies will just spawn and block the road
- camp has been destroyed, win

4 Neighbors (x)
- There is a small village
- They are "friendly"
- Path is blocked by a unit (since they are in fact hostile, the player has to attack the unit)
- Task: Find a way to continue
- This triggers the hostile actions (allowing the AI to play)
- Hint: Friend says sometimes you don't only take some lives but also lose friends / or maybe rather something about losing someone without death
- As soon as the way is cleared, hostile armies spawn in the start base
- This happens by spawning some armies on previous trees or mountains (maybe just alter MMAP for this)
- They are just high level, thus destroy all buildings -> only one player army needs to finish the way, but defending wont work (probably)
- After losing the HQ, the mission ends
- Friend is captured (thus lost)

5 Soul Rescue
- This is rather about saving your own soul than someone elses
- Your friend is captured
- A small prison, surrounded by a bandit camp
- Task: Free your friend
- Maybe this one should have two camps
- You can decide to attack either, then the friend spawns in the other camp
- That way it wont matter which you take, but always triggers "you take the easy road" event, which actually spawns strong units on the other side
- Hint: A strong unit spawns to kill your friend -> when he dies, he tells you, that you lost him years ago
- You still need to fight your way through
- It's a trap, you get caught and into a Prison

6 Prosin
- The hint is already in the title, since it's Prison
- You wake up in a small cell
- A voice, probably in another cell, tells you, you should break out and help both of you
- Asking for the name: It's Prosin, how long he has been there, always (since everybody has a dark side)
- This is just the testmap a bit improved and nicely done
- Uppon leaving, there is a new grave next to the path
- Clicking on it: "Here lies Uoy"

7 Team (x)
- Since Prosin helped you (actually did nothing but hey), he suggests working together
- Hint: Text says maybe we could turn this world by 180 degree (which then explains going to the dark side)
- He wants help freeing his homelands
- so this is just a mission to kill some people
- There is one base to destroy
