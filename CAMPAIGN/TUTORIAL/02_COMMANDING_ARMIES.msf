@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |3          |4          |LEFT  |0      |FACE_2          |Let's start with something simple: army movement. For starters, selecting an army will reveal some visual information on the possible actions on the surrounding tiles.
@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |4          |5          |LEFT  |0      |FACE_2          |There are actually four different actions: \n \n No action \n Move \n Attack \n Merge
@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |5          |6          |RIGHT |0      |SELECTION_TILE_INVALID  |This means that the selected army can't do anything on that tile. This can have multiple reasons. Either the army can't move to that spot, since it is blocked by an object or the army doesn't have action points left.
@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |6          |7          |LEFT  |0      |FACE_2          |Action points or movement points are used up by different actions. We will start with movement.
@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |7          |8          |RIGHT |0      |SELECTION_TILE_MOVE     |Armies can move to any tile without blocking obstacles. Examples of blocking obstacles include terrain features, large objects, or hostile entities.
@SHOW_DIALOGUE  |8          |9          |LEFT  |0      |FACE_2          |Each movement costs 1 action point. An army has a maximum of 2 action points. This means, an army can move 2 tiles per round. Each round, all action points are replenished.
